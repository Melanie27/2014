</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Making Changes</h2>

<ul>

<h2>Code Documentation</h2>

<ul>

<li>An example function can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdevalk/5574677">here</a></li>
<li>Please make sure that every function is documented so that when we update our API Documentation things don&rsquo;t go awry!</li>
